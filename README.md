# Virtual-Agent-Chatbot

This is my **first JavaScript project ever**, created for my AP Computer Science Principles class.  
It simulates a virtual assistant chatbot that helps customers check the status of their orders in an online store.

## Features
- Prompts the user for their name, a 5-digit customer number, and an 8-digit order number
- Greets the customer and confirms an agent will be with them shortly
- Displays the order status (shipped, delayed, or in progress)
- Generates a custom chat number from parts of the customer and order numbers

## Purpose
This project was made to practice basic JavaScript, user input, variables, string methods, and output.

> **Note:** I’m keeping the original code exactly as I wrote it for learning and memory.  
> It shows where I started — and I’m proud of it!
